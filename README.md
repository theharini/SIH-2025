AgriPlay – Gamified Platform to Promote Sustainable Farming Practices
Overview

AgriPlay is an interactive, gamified platform designed to educate farmers on sustainable farming practices. By using mini-games, rewards, and personalized tips, AgriPlay motivates farmers to make smarter, environmentally friendly choices in irrigation, pest management, and crop care.

This project was developed for SIH 2025 under the theme of Smart Agriculture & Sustainability.

Features

🎮 Gamified Learning – Farmers learn sustainable farming practices through simple and engaging mini-games.

💧 Irrigation Simulator – Helps users choose optimal water schedules to save water and improve yield.

🏅 Rewards & Leaderboards – Points, badges, and leaderboards encourage continuous learning.

🤖 AI Recommendation Engine – Provides personalized tips based on user choices.

📊 Impact Visualization – Tracks progress and shows real-world benefits like water saved and improved crop yield.

Problem Statement

Farmers face multiple challenges in Kerala and across India:

Water scarcity & unpredictable rainfall

Crop loss due to pests & diseases

Low awareness of modern sustainable practices

Limited access to fair market prices

Low digital literacy for new agricultural tools

AgriPlay addresses these issues by educating farmers in an interactive, game-like environment.

How It Works

User Interaction – Farmer plays mini-games to make decisions (e.g., irrigation, crop care).

Data Analysis – Choices are analyzed to provide immediate feedback.

Reward System – Points, badges, and leaderboard positions motivate engagement.

AI Recommendations – Personalized suggestions for better sustainability practices.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap / MIT App Inventor (prototype)

Backend: Firebase (for storing user progress and leaderboard)

AI / ML: TensorFlow.js (for gesture recognition and personalized tips)

Gamification: Badges, points, and leaderboard logic implemented in frontend
